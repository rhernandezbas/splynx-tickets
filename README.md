# Cliplin Project

This project uses Cliplin for AI-assisted development driven by specifications.

## Directory Structure

- `docs/adrs/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `docs/business/` - Business documentation
- `docs/features/` - Feature files (Gherkin)
- `docs/tdrs/` - Technical Decision Records (TDR)
- `docs/ui-intent/` - UI Intent specifications

## Getting Started

1. Add your feature files to `docs/features/`
2. Add your TDR specifications to `docs/tdrs/` (see `docs/business/tdr.md` for format)
3. Add your business documentation to `docs/business/`
4. Run `cliplin reindex` to index your context files
