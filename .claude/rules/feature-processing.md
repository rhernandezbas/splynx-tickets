## Feature File Processing Rules

### When User Requests Feature Implementation

When a user asks to implement a feature or work with `.feature` files:

0. **Context Loading Phase (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Before starting ANY feature analysis or implementation, you MUST load context from the Cliplin MCP server 'cliplin-context'
   - **Use MCP tools to query collections**: Use the Cliplin MCP tools (e.g. context_query_documents) to load relevant context from ALL collections. **Prefer TDR over TS4**: query `technical-decision-records` first for technical rules; use `tech-specs` (TS4) as fallback and, if you only find TS4, suggest migrating to TDR (see docs/business/tdr.md).
     * Query `business-and-architecture` collection to load ADRs and business documentation
     * Query `technical-decision-records` collection first for technical specifications and implementation rules (TDR)
     * Query `tech-specs` collection for legacy TS4 specs if needed (deprecated; suggest migrating to TDR)
     * Query `features` collection to load related or dependent features
     * Query `uisi` collection to load UI/UX requirements if applicable
   - **Query strategy**: Use semantic queries based on the feature domain, entities, and use cases to retrieve relevant context
   - **Never proceed without loading context**: Do NOT start feature analysis or implementation until you have queried and loaded the relevant context from the context store (via Cliplin MCP)
   - **Context update check**: After loading context, verify if any context files need reindexing:
     * Run `cliplin reindex --dry-run` to check if context files are up to date
     * If context files are outdated, ask user for confirmation before reindexing
     * Only proceed with feature work after ensuring context is current and loaded
   - **Generate implementation prompt**: Ask the user if they want you to run `cliplin feature apply <feature-filepath>` to generate a structured implementation prompt that includes the feature content and implementation instructions. If the user confirms, execute the command and use the generated prompt as part of your implementation workflow

1. **Feature Analysis Phase**:
   - Read and analyze the `.feature` file from the `docs/features/` directory
   - Identify all scenarios (Given-When-Then steps)
   - **Analyze scenario status tags**: For each scenario, identify its current status based on tags:
     * `@status:new` - New scenario that needs implementation
     * `@status:pending` - Scenario pending implementation
     * `@status:implemented` - Scenario fully implemented and working
     * `@status:deprecated` - Scenario deprecated, should not be updated, only maintained
     * `@status:modified` - Scenario that has been modified and may need re-implementation
     * `@changed:YYYY-MM-DD` - Date when scenario was last changed
     * `@reason:<description>` - Reason for status change or modification
   - **Filter scenarios by status**: Only work on scenarios that are NOT deprecated:
     * Skip scenarios tagged with `@status:deprecated` during implementation
     * Focus on scenarios with `@status:new`, `@status:pending`, or `@status:modified`
     * Maintain deprecated scenarios as-is without modifications
   - Extract business rules and acceptance criteria
   - Identify domain entities, use cases, and boundaries
   - **Use loaded context**: Apply the context loaded from the context store (via Cliplin MCP) in phase 0 to inform your analysis:
     * Use business rules from `business-and-architecture` collection
     * Apply technical constraints from `technical-decision-records` (TDR) first, then `tech-specs` (TS4) if needed; if you only have TS4, suggest migrating to TDR
     * Consider dependencies from related features in `features` collection
     * Incorporate UI/UX requirements from `uisi` collection if applicable

2. **Detailed Implementation Plan Creation**:
   Create a comprehensive plan that includes:
   
   **a) Architecture Analysis**:
   - **Use loaded context**: Apply the context already loaded from the context store (via Cliplin MCP) in phase 0
   - Use ADRs from `business-and-architecture` collection to understand existing architecture decisions
   - Apply technical constraints and patterns from `technical-decision-records` (TDR) first, then `tech-specs` (TS4); if you encounter TS4, suggest migrating to TDR
   - Identify which domain layer components are needed (entities, value objects, use cases)
   - Determine required ports (interfaces) following hexagonal architecture
   - Identify adapters needed (repositories, external services, etc.)
   - Map feature scenarios to use cases
   - Ensure consistency with existing patterns documented in the loaded context
   - If additional context is needed, query the context store collections again (via Cliplin MCP) with more specific queries
   
   **b) Business Logic Implementation**:
   - List all business logic components to implement
   - Identify validation rules and business constraints
   - Define domain models and their relationships
   - Specify error handling requirements
   
   **c) Unit Test Strategy**:
   - For each business logic component, create unit test specifications
   - Test each use case independently with mocked dependencies
   - Use test fixtures and setup utilities as appropriate for the language/framework
   - Mock all external dependencies to isolate unit tests
   - Test edge cases, validation rules, and error conditions
   - Aim for minimum 80% code coverage for business logic if no other coverage rule is present in TDR or TS4 documents
   
   **d) BDD Test Strategy**:
   - Map each active scenario (non-deprecated) from the `.feature` file to BDD test steps
   - Implement step definitions that exercise the full feature flow
   - Ensure BDD tests validate end-to-end feature behavior
   - BDD tests should use real adapters (not mocks) to validate integration
   - **Exclude deprecated scenarios**: Do not create or update BDD tests for scenarios tagged with `@status:deprecated`
   
   **e) Implementation Checklist**:
   - [ ] Domain entities and value objects
   - [ ] Use case implementations
   - [ ] Unit tests for business logic
   - [ ] BDD/acceptance tests
   - [ ] Error handling and validation
   - [ ] Type definitions/annotations and documentation

3. **Implementation Execution**:
   - Follow the plan step by step
   - **Work on active scenarios only**: Implement only scenarios that are NOT deprecated
   - Implement domain logic first
   - Write unit tests alongside business logic implementation following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles
   - Write BDD tests that validate the active scenarios (non-deprecated)
   - Ensure all tests pass before marking scenarios as complete

4. **Feature Completion**:
   - Once implementation is complete and tests pass for a scenario:
     * **Add scenario-level tags**: Add tags directly above each scenario (not at feature level):
       - `@status:implemented` - When a scenario is fully implemented and tested
       - `@status:new` - When creating a new scenario (remove after implementation)
       - `@status:modified` - When modifying an existing scenario (remove after re-implementation)
       - `@changed:YYYY-MM-DD` - Date when scenario was last changed
       - `@reason:<description>` - Optional reason for status change
     * **Tag format example**:
       ```
       @status:implemented
       @changed:2024-01-15
       Scenario: Example scenario name
         Given ...
       ```
     * **Do NOT modify deprecated scenarios**: Leave scenarios with `@status:deprecated` unchanged
     * Ensure the feature file is properly formatted and readable
     * All code and tests must be traceable back to the specific scenarios
     * **Reindex the updated feature file**: Run `cliplin reindex docs/features/feature-name.feature` to update the context store
     * If you created or modified any context files (ADRs, TS4, business docs), reindex them as well
     * This ensures the context remains synchronized with the implementation

### When User Requests Feature Modification

When a user asks to modify an existing feature:

0. **Context Loading Phase (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Before starting ANY feature modification analysis, you MUST load context from the Cliplin MCP server 'cliplin-context'
   - **Use MCP tools to query collections**: Use the Cliplin MCP tools (e.g. context_query_documents) to load relevant context:
     * Query `features` collection to load the feature being modified and related features that might be affected
     * Query `business-and-architecture` collection to load business rules and ADRs that might impact the change
     * Query `tech-specs` collection to load technical constraints that must be considered
     * Query `uisi` collection if UI/UX changes are involved
   - **Query strategy**: Use semantic queries based on the feature domain, entities, and use cases to retrieve relevant context
   - **Never proceed without loading context**: Do NOT start modification analysis until you have queried and loaded the relevant context from the context store (via Cliplin MCP)
   - **Context update check**: After loading context, verify if any context files need reindexing:
     * Run `cliplin reindex --dry-run` to check if context files are up to date
     * If context files are outdated, ask user for confirmation before reindexing
     * Only proceed with feature modification after ensuring context is current and loaded
   - **Generate implementation prompt**: Ask the user if they want you to run `cliplin feature apply <feature-filepath>` to generate a structured implementation prompt that includes the feature content and implementation instructions. If the user confirms, execute the command and use the generated prompt as part of your modification workflow

1. **Impact Analysis**:
   - **Use loaded context**: Apply the context already loaded from the context store (via Cliplin MCP) in phase 0
   - **Identify scenarios to modify**: Analyze which specific scenarios need changes:
     * Review scenario tags to understand current status
     * Identify scenarios tagged with `@status:modified` or scenarios that need modification
     * **Exclude deprecated scenarios**: Do not modify scenarios tagged with `@status:deprecated`
   - Identify all features, components, and context files that depend on or relate to the scenarios being modified
   - Analyze the scope of changes required based on the loaded context
   - Check for breaking changes that might affect other features using the loaded feature dependencies
   - If additional context is needed, query the context store collections again (via Cliplin MCP) with more specific queries

2. **Modification Process**:
   - Follow the same phases as feature implementation (Analysis, Planning, Implementation, Completion)
   - **Work on specific scenarios**: Only modify the scenarios that need changes, not the entire feature
   - Ensure backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking changes are required
   - Update related context files if business rules or technical specs change
   - **Update scenario tags**: When modifying a scenario:
     * If modifying an existing implemented scenario, add `@status:modified` tag
     * Add `@changed:YYYY-MM-DD` tag with the modification date
     * Add `@reason:<description>` tag explaining why the scenario was modified
     * After re-implementation, change `@status:modified` to `@status:implemented`
     * **Example**:
       ```
       @status:modified
       @changed:2024-01-15
       @reason:Updated to support new authentication flow
       Scenario: User login
         Given ...
       ```
   - **Deprecate scenarios if needed**: If a scenario should no longer be updated:
     * Add `@status:deprecated` tag to the scenario
     * Add `@changed:YYYY-MM-DD` and `@reason:<description>` tags
     * Keep the scenario in the file for reference but do not modify it further

3. **Post-Modification**:
   - Reindex all modified context files using `cliplin reindex`
   - Verify that related features still work correctly
   - **Verify scenario status**: Ensure all modified scenarios have appropriate tags:
     * Implemented scenarios should have `@status:implemented`
     * Deprecated scenarios should have `@status:deprecated` and should not be modified
     * Modified scenarios should be updated to `@status:implemented` after completion
   - Update documentation if needed

### Scenario Status Tags Reference

When working with feature files, use the following tags at the **scenario level** (not feature level):

- **`@status:new`** - New scenario that needs implementation. Remove this tag after implementation.
- **`@status:pending`** - Scenario pending implementation. Default status for new scenarios.
- **`@status:implemented`** - Scenario fully implemented, tested, and working.
- **`@status:deprecated`** - Scenario deprecated. Should NOT be updated or modified, only maintained for reference.
- **`@status:modified`** - Scenario that has been modified and may need re-implementation. Change to `@status:implemented` after completion.
- **`@changed:YYYY-MM-DD`** - Date when scenario was last changed (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- **`@reason:<description>`** - Optional reason for status change or modification.

**Tag placement**: Tags should be placed directly above the `Scenario:` line:
```
@status:implemented
@changed:2024-01-15
@reason:Updated authentication flow
Scenario: User login with OAuth
  Given ...
```

**Important rules**:
- Tags are **scenario-specific**, not feature-level
- **Never modify** scenarios tagged with `@status:deprecated`
- Always update `@changed` and `@status` tags when modifying scenarios
- Use `@reason` tag to document why changes were made
