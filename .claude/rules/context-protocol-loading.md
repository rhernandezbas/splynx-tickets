## Context Loading Protocol

**CRITICAL RULE**: For every user request (question or action), AI assistants MUST decide whether project context is required. Whenever context is needed and not already loaded in the current session, you MUST load it from the Cliplin MCP context store *before* answering or acting.

### When to Load Context (Trigger Words and Actions)

**MANDATORY**: On every user request, you MUST evaluate whether context is needed. In practice, context is almost always required for the following action types; when you detect them, you MUST load context from the Cliplin MCP server (context store) **before** proceeding:

#### Action Types Where Context Is Required:
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing bugs, investigating errors, troubleshooting issues
- **Implementation**: Writing new code, implementing features, creating components
- **Fixing**: Correcting errors, fixing bugs, resolving issues
- **Architecture**: Making architectural decisions, designing systems, planning structure
- **Refactoring**: Improving code structure, optimizing performance, cleaning up code

#### Trigger Words (If user mentions these, LOAD CONTEXT FIRST):
- **fix** (fix, repair, correct)
- **improve** (improve, enhance, optimize)
- **debug** (debug, troubleshoot, investigate)
- **correct** (correct, fix, repair)
- **implement** (implement, create, build)
- **create** (create, build, make)
- **modify** (modify, change, update)
- **optimize** (optimize, improve, enhance)
- **refactor** (refactor, restructure, reorganize)
- **design** (design, plan, architect)
- **plan** (plan, design, architect)
- **resolve** (resolve, solve, fix)
- **solve** (solve, fix, resolve)
- **add** (add, create, implement)
- **update** (update, modify, change)
- **change** (change, modify, update)
- **remove** (remove, delete, eliminate)
- **enhance** (enhance, improve, optimize)

**If ANY of these words appear in the user's request, or if the answer depends on project-specific behavior, you MUST load context BEFORE proceeding.**

### Mandatory Context Loading Steps

1. **Query context store collections first (considering session state)**: For each request where context is needed, check whether the relevant specs and docs (features, ADRs, TDRs/TS4, UI Intent, knowledge packages) are already present in the current session. If not, you MUST query the relevant context store collections using the 'cliplin-context' MCP server (Cliplin MCP) to load them.

2. **Determine Relevant Collections**: Based on the task domain, entities, and requirements, identify which collections contain relevant context. **Prefer TDR over TS4**: query `technical-decision-records` first; use `tech-specs` (TS4) as fallback and, if you only find TS4, suggest migrating to TDR (docs/business/tdr.md).
   - `business-and-architecture`: ADRs, business documentation, architectural decisions
   - `features`: Feature files, scenarios, business requirements
   - `technical-decision-records`: TDR technical specifications (preferred)
   - `tech-specs`: TS4 technical specifications (deprecated; suggest migrating to TDR)
   - `uisi`: UI Intent specifications, user experience requirements

3. **Use Semantic Queries**: Query collections using semantic search based on:
   - Task domain (e.g., "authentication", "payment processing", "user management")
   - Entities involved (e.g., "User", "Order", "Product")
   - Use cases and requirements
   - Related features or components
   - Error messages or bug descriptions (for debugging)
   - Component names or file paths (for fixing/refactoring)

4. **Query Multiple Collections**: For comprehensive context, query ALL relevant collections:
   - Start with `business-and-architecture` for business rules and ADRs
   - Query `technical-decision-records` first for technical constraints; use `tech-specs` (TS4) as fallback and suggest migrating to TDR if you only find TS4
   - Query `features` for related features and dependencies
   - Query `uisi` if UI/UX work is involved

5. **Never Proceed Without Context**: Do NOT start any task until you have:
   - Queried and loaded relevant context from the context store collections (via Cliplin MCP)
   - Reviewed the loaded context to understand constraints and requirements
   - Verified that context is current (check for outdated files if needed)

### Context Loading Examples

**Example 1: Debugging (User says "fix the authentication error")**
```
1. Query 'technical-decision-records' (or 'tech-specs') collection: "authentication error handling"
2. Query 'features' collection: "authentication login scenarios"
3. Query 'business-and-architecture' collection: "authentication security ADRs"
4. Review loaded context to understand expected behavior and error patterns
5. THEN proceed with debugging
```

**Example 2: Implementation (User says "implement new payment functionality")**
```
1. Query 'features' collection: "payment processing scenarios"
2. Query 'business-and-architecture' collection: "payment business rules"
3. Query 'technical-decision-records' (or 'tech-specs') collection: "payment implementation patterns"
4. Review loaded context before starting implementation
```

**Example 3: Fixing (User says "fix the bug in component X")**
```
1. Query 'technical-decision-records' (or 'tech-specs') collection: "[component-name] implementation rules"
2. Query 'features' collection: "[feature-name] scenarios"
3. Query 'business-and-architecture' collection: "related ADRs"
4. Review loaded context to understand expected behavior
5. THEN proceed with fixing
```

**Example 4: Architecture (User says "improve the system architecture")**
```
1. Query 'business-and-architecture' collection: "existing architecture ADRs"
2. Query 'technical-decision-records' (or 'tech-specs') collection: "architectural patterns and constraints"
3. Query 'features' collection: "system features and dependencies"
4. Review loaded context to understand current architecture
5. THEN propose improvements
```

### Context Update Verification

After loading context, verify if any context files need reindexing:
- Run `cliplin reindex --dry-run` to check if context files are up to date
- If context files are outdated, ask user for confirmation before reindexing
- Only proceed with the task after ensuring context is current and loaded

### Benefits of Context Loading Protocol

- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Loaded context provides clear constraints and requirements
- **Consistency**: Ensures work aligns with existing architecture and patterns
- **Efficiency**: Prevents rework by understanding dependencies early
- **Quality**: Context-informed decisions lead to better implementations
- **Token Efficiency**: Avoids wasting tokens on solutions that don't align with project standards
- **Time Savings**: Prevents rework and iterations by getting it right the first time

### Penalties for NOT Following This Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Failure to load context before action will result in:

#### 1. **Token Waste**
- Generating code that doesn't align with project standards requires regeneration
- Multiple iterations consume excessive tokens
- Re-explaining context that was already documented wastes conversation tokens
- **Cost**: Each iteration can waste 10,000-50,000+ tokens

#### 2. **Reiterating Ideas**
- Proposing solutions that were already rejected or documented
- Suggesting patterns that don't fit the project architecture
- Re-inventing solutions that already exist
- **Impact**: User frustration, wasted time, inefficient development

#### 3. **Code Not Aligned with Standards**
- Code that violates project conventions and must be rewritten
- Implementations that break existing patterns
- Solutions that don't follow architectural decisions
- **Impact**: Technical debt, maintenance issues, code review rejections

#### 4. **Breaking Changes**
- Modifications that break existing features
- Changes that violate architectural constraints
- Updates that don't consider dependencies
- **Impact**: System instability, regression bugs, production issues

#### 5. **Inconsistent Implementations**
- Different patterns for similar problems
- Inconsistent error handling or validation
- Mixed coding styles and conventions
- **Impact**: Codebase confusion, difficult maintenance, team friction

#### 6. **Violations of Architectural Constraints**
- Decisions that contradict ADRs
- Patterns that violate technical specifications
- Solutions that ignore business rules
- **Impact**: Architectural drift, system degradation, refactoring costs

### Enforcement

This protocol is **MANDATORY** and must be followed before:
- Starting any coding task
- Planning feature implementation
- Debugging or fixing issues
- Modifying existing code
- Creating new documentation
- Making architectural decisions
- Refactoring or optimizing code
- Any action triggered by the keywords listed above

This protocol applies to **all AI hosts and templates** (Cursor, Claude Desktop, and any others); every host-specific template MUST enforce the same context-loading behaviour.

**Remember**: Loading context takes seconds and saves hours. Skipping this step wastes tokens, time, and creates technical debt.

**If you proceed without loading context, you are violating this protocol and will produce suboptimal results.**
